\title{Cryptographic Hashing Using the SHA-256 Algorithm}
\usage{
sha256(x, convert = TRUE, file)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object to hash. A character string or raw vector (without
attributes) is hashed 'as is'. All other objects are stream hashed using
R serialization, but without requiring allocation of the serialized
object. To ensure portability, serialization version 3 big-endian
represenation is always used with headers skipped (as these contain R
version and native encoding information).}

\item{convert}{[default TRUE] if TRUE, the hash is converted to its hex
representation as a character string, if FALSE, output directly as a raw
vector, or if NA, a vector of (32-bit) integer values.}

\item{file}{character file name / path. If specified, 'x' is ignored. The
file is stream hashed, thus capable of handling files larger than memory.}
}
\value{
A character string, raw or integer vector depending on 'convert'.
}
\description{
Returns a SHA-256 hash of the supplied object or file.

\details{
The SHA-256 Secure Hash Standard was published by the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2002 at
    \url{https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2.pdf}.
    
    This implementation is based on one by 'The Mbed TLS Contributors' under
    the 'Mbed TLS' Trusted Firmware Project at
    \url{https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/mbed-tls}.

\examples{
# SHA-256 hash as character string:
sha256("secret base")

# SHA-256 hash as raw vector:
sha256("secret base", convert = FALSE)

# SHA-256 hash a file:
file <- tempfile(); cat("secret base", file = file)
sha256(file = file)
unlink(file)

}
