Title: Cryptographic Hash, Extendable-Output and Base64 Functions
Version: 1.0.0
Description: Fast and memory-efficient streaming hash functions and base64
    encoding and decoding. Performs direct hashing of strings and raw vectors.
    Stream hashes files potentially larger than memory, as well as in-memory
    objects through R's serialization mechanism. Implementations include the
    SHA-256, SHA-3 and 'Keccak' cryptographic hash functions, SHAKE256
    extendable-output function (XOF), and 'SipHash' pseudo-random function.
