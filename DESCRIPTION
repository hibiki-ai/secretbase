Title: Cryptographic Hash and Extendable-Output Functions
Version: 0.0.5
Description: Fast, dependency-free SHA-3 cryptographic hash and SHAKE256
    extendable-output function (XOF) algorithms. The SHA-3 Secure Hash Standard
    was published by NIST in 2015 at <doi:10.6028/NIST.FIPS.202>. Uses the
